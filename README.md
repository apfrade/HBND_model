## HBNDmodel

Hydrogen bond network dimensionality (HBND) describes how hydrogen-bond intermolecular interactions extend in a three-dimensional structure. 

The network arrangement is thought to influence properties where hydrogen bonding plays critical  role, such as crystal stability,  mechanical  behaviour  and compound tabletability performance.

The hydrogen bond network dimensionality problem can be formulated as a four-class classification task, and the four possible network dimensionality outcomes are schematically represented below.

We provide a ready to usemodel for Hydrogen Bond Network Dimensionality prediction. 

   Input: list of SMILES of the molecules to be predicted

   Output: a list of (class, SMILES) pairs

   Performance: 59% accuracy (compared to a 25% random threshold)

See the reference for more details.

# Disclamer:

1) The model is only prepared to predict the HBND of single chemical component organic crystals.

2) Using the model as is may only be suitable for initial initial screening of large libraries.
   The trust of output predictions can be increased by subjecting the model to a confidence threshold. This
   approach may enable further single compound HBND profilling (link).
